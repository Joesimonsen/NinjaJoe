This is awesome
I am going to finish this and understand the basics of it.  Then i would
like to find a way to apply it at work somehow.  Although I think these concepts are over everyones head right now.  At least I can use them myself.

Hard to find a way to use this at work.  I wonder how this would work for us since no one codes anything.
